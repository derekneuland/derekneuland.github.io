            <h5 class="w3-opacity">The Perfect Storm for a Creative Renaissance</h5>
         
            <hr>
            <p>We are on the verge of a creative renaissance. The world is changing and technology is evolving at an unprecedented
            rate. This is opening up new opportunities for creativity and expression.</p>
            <p>It has never been easier to be a creator. With the tools and resources available today, anyone can start creating and
            sharing their work with the world. This is driving a surge in creativity and innovation. Going one step further,
            advancements in natural language processing technology has brought on a new world to create inside of. Thanks to machine
            learning models such as OpenAI's GPT-3, it is now possible for any text you can imagine to be generated by a machine.
            Dalle-2 is doing the same for still images. In the next 3-5 years, I imagine we will be able to input a movie script and
            the output will be a movie that could premier in theaters around the world (I love the idea of fan fiction versions of
            movies. The ability to take fan created versions of existing characters and universes and see them realized visually
            will be really exciting to see).</p>
            <p>That being said, I don't think these tools will replace the creativity of humans. I believe these innovations will help
            us become more creative by alleviating the parts of creativity we don't enjoy. Think about your personal creation
            process and every step you take from idea to publish. What are your favorite steps? What are your least favorite steps?
            Finding tools that can help automate your least favorite steps could free your time and energy up so you can focus on
            creating more impactful and meaningful art.</p>
            <p>We are seeing new forms of expression emerge, through mediums like virtual reality and augmented reality. These
            technologies are giving people new ways to experience and interact with the world around them.</p>
            <p>We are also seeing a rise in popularity of DIY and maker culture. People are taking matters into their own hands and
            creating things that they want to see in the world. This trend is only going to continue as we see more people empowered
            to create their own products and experiences. Deep Learning will be critical in this venture.</p>
            <p>All of these factors are coming together to create a perfect storm for a creative renaissance. We are on the brink of
            something big, something special. So let's embrace it, nurture it, and see where it takes us. Artificial reasoning.</p>


            <p>I think we need to re-examine what a “lifetime” should be defined as. Unlike how “literally” became redefined out of
            ignorance, I believe rethinking the definition of “lifetime” is one of adapting to an ever changing and growing world.</p>
            <p>The idea of “lifetime” has been engrained in our vocabulary for decades. Lifetime warranty. Lifetime guarantee. “That
            will last you a lifetime!” The idea was it would last you your entire life. Until you could no longer physically use it.</p>
            <p>This also translates to careers and relationships. When have you heard the phrase “that job will last you until you're
            retired/dead” lately? I haven't. “Till death do us part” is a disgusting old patriarchal saying that guilts people into
            staying in unhappy and/or abusive relationships and marriages.</p>
            <h3>I believe a lifetime should be defined how you want to define it.</h3>
            <p>People have called them “phases” in the past. But that diminishes them. You could call it a “period of my life”, but
            that also feels like it was just temporary. As if it was a rest stop on your way to your “finish line”.</p>
            <p>I think it's important we acknowledge and appreciate what we can from our past lifetimes. They weren't perfect. We made
            some really dumb mistakes. But we grew from them. We learned about ourselves. We learned about the world. We learned how
            to exist.</p>
            <p>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) represents a transformative paradigm in the field of artificial intelligence, transcending the                 limitations of domain-specific, narrow AI systems. As a hypothetical construct, AGI embodies the vision of designing machines with the  
            cognitive prowess to understand, learn, and adapt across a wide spectrum of tasks, matching or even surpassing human intellectual                        capabilities. This advanced form of AI not only holds the potential to revolutionize industries, but also to reshape societal frameworks,                catalyzing breakthroughs in areas such as medicine, environmental conservation, and space exploration. However, the development and                      implementation of AGI also raises profound ethical and safety concerns, prompting interdisciplinary collaboration to ensure its responsible              and benevolent application in alignment with the long-term interests of humanity..</p>
        
            <p>I was still a child. I was still learning how to exist. I didn't know I had ADHD or anxiety or severe depression. I
            didn't know I was non-binary or queer yet. I didn't know who I was yet. Truthfully, I still don't. But i'm learning more
            everyday.</p>
    

   
            <p>The following collection of thoughts and ideas assumes you believe there are more genders than the binary male and
            female, what non-binary gender is, what gender neutral pronouns are, and most importantly you want to learn how you can
            be more inclusive. Oh, also that you're familiar with The Office.</p>
            <p>Giving your website a more gender-neutral tone can be extremely helpful in making everyone feel welcome. In the United
            States, there are over 1.2 million adults who are non-binary. Even beyond that staggering amount (which is 11% of LGBTQ+
            adults in the US), an increasing number of humans are using gender pronouns other than he/him and she/her, and not all
            identify as transgender or non-binary. Gender neutral language is becoming more prevalent and accepted every year.</p>
            <p>In the English language, "he" has often been used as an automatic fill-in for generic individuals. By using
            gender-neutral language, you're ensuring your sentences are inclusive for everyone. For example, if you are describing
            someone performing an action or behavior, unless the gender of the individual is important to the sentence, gender
            neutral pronouns can be used to ensure those reading your website feel included.</p>
            <h3>e.g. This candle is so decadent and fragrant you won't want to wait until he comes over to light it.</h3>
            <p>This description for a candle (that I wrote for this example) makes it sound like the only people this candle is for is
            people who date men or male identifying individuals. If it was worded “you won't want to wait until they come over to
            light it.”, it doesn't lose any meaning and it's more inclusive.</p>
            <p>Using gender neutral language helps to break down the harmful binary system which can be limiting for everyone. The
            pronouns "he and she" are two extreme binaries that don't leave room for other gender identities. This can be limiting
            or harmful for individuals who don't identify with either pronoun.</p>
            <p>There have been many studies about the positive effect of using gender neutral pronouns. Making a conscious effort to
            use more inclusive language on your website will help millions of people feel more included, as well as avoid falling
            into any unintentional gender stereotypes (Michael Scott's well timed but cringeworthy “that's what she said” tagline
            comes to mind).</p>
